# Solana Message Dapp - Anchor | Next.JS

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The responsive version for wallets and wallet adapter may not function or work as expected for mobile based on plugin and wallet compatibility. For more code examples and implementations please visit the [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/)

## Global installation

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## App installation

```bash
cd app && npm install
# or
cd app && yarn install
```

## Programs installation

```bash
cd programs/messagelearn && anchor test
```

Make sure to have a Solana wallet linked in Anchor.toml
and to have enough SOL (5 SOL minimum). You can solana airdrop 5 or
use an online faucet like : https://solfaucet.com/

## Build and Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
